# 📊 IT Operations & Support Performance Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze IT support tickets and infrastructure logs to identify trends, bottlenecks in technical operations and improve response times (SLA).

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and transformation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for trend visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis.
- **PowerBI** for dashboards

## 🧠 Analytical Focus
To provide a comprehensive overview of IT operations, the project covers:
- **Trend Discovery:** Analyzing ticket volume fluctuations over time.
- **SLA Performance:** Evaluating compliance rates across different priority levels.
- **Efficiency Metrics:** Measuring Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) by category.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Pinpointing infrastructure components prone to failure.

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations
- **Peak Load Patterns:** 30% of critical hardware issues occur on Monday mornings. 
  *Recommendation: Implement proactive server health checks on Sunday evenings.*
- **SLA Bottlenecks:** 'Software Access' requests take 40% longer than 'Hardware Repairs' despite lower complexity.
  *Recommendation: Automate identity management workflows to reduce manual overhead.*
- **Infrastructure Correlation:** Identified a high correlation between firmware updates and subsequent network-related spikes.
  *Recommendation: Review update protocols and increase on-call support during deployment windows.*
